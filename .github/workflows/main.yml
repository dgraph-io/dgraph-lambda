# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Pull the latest image to build, and avoid caching pull-only images.
      # (docker pull is faster than caching in most cases.)
      - run: docker-compose pull

      # In this step, this action saves a list of existing images,
      # the cache is created without them in the post run.
      # It also restores the cache if it exists.
      - uses: satackey/action-docker-layer-caching@v0.0.8
        continue-on-error: true

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Run Tests
        run: docker-compose run --rm -T -e NODE_ENV=test dgraph-lambda test
